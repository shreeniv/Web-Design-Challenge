# Web-Design-Challenge

A landing page 'Web Visualizations Landing' (index.html) containing:

Links to each visualizations pages:
temperature.html
humidity.html
cloudiness.html
windspeed.html

sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization from main 'index.html'

Four visualization pages, each with:
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
-temperature.html
-humidity.html
-cloudiness.html
-windspeed.html

A "Comparisons" page that: comparisons.html
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

A "Data" page that: data.html
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table must be a bootstrap table component
