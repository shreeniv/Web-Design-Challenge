    <h2>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h2>
    <hl>
    <p1>
        The purpose of this project as weo analyze how weather changes as <br>
        you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first <br>
        pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble the dataset on <br>
        over 500 cities.  
    </p1>
    <p2>
        After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various <br>
        aspects of the weather va. latitude. Factors we looked at included: <br>
        tempperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and <br>
        visualizations created as a part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends <br>
        and correlations witnessed.
